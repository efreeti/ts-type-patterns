# Repository of crazy typescript typing patterns.

Being in love with TypeScript type system and how far it evolved, I still find myself too often spending a lot of time figuring out certain way of applying it's type system to a specific problem. I constantly find my self doing similar type defnitions again and again. So why not put them in the one repository, document approach, examples and problems and maybe with time this can grow in full blown repository of reusable code.
